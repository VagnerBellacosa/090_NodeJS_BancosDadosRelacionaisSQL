### Follower (HA) plans

In the face of hardware or software failure of the leader node, ElephantSQL will make an automatic failover to the follower on all HA (high availability) plans. The follower can be located in another region or even at a different cloud provider.

### Replication across Clouds

We are proud to be the first SaaS option for PostgreSQL that have support for streaming replication across clouds. Our clustering options, fork, point-in-time recovery, and followers, allow the databases to be in different regions or even at different cloud providers.
